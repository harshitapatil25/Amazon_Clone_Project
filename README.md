Welcome to my HTML & CSS Amazon Clone repository! Here, you'll find my version of the Amazon homepage made with HTML and CSS technologies. Right now, it only has the homepage, but it still captures the essence of the Amazon shopping experience. There's a elegant header design, dynamic product sections and responsive layout that adapts well to different screen sizes.

I'm still working on it, so feel free to check out the code and share your ideas. Let's make this project even better together! We can add more features and pages to make it even more like the real Amazon.
